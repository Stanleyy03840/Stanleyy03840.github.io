# 5.4 Crowdsourcing
--------

## Notes
* Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
* Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems
* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices



## Actions
### CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
A crowdsource idea would be to analyze the number of students who use a macbook compared to the number of students who use a windows laptop. This idea can be initiated by creating a survey of some sort and sending it in the slack announcements channel.

### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
Our final project could be better with crowdsourcing by taking in the opinions of all DNHS track. Since we are creating a website for track and field, we do not only want inputs of people from one event. Rather, we should take the whole program into consideration when making a website.
