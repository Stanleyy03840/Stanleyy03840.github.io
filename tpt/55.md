## Actions
### When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
* MIT License: allows people to freely use, make, and distribute closed source versions
* GPL License: doesn't allow for distributing closed source versions

### Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
* I chose the GNU General Public License v3 for my personal and team project because I think it gives people the most freedom to use, distribute, and modify the software
