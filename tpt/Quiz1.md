## Corrections
* Q29: Option A is incorrect because when testing [9, 1, 4, 5] the program displays 28, rather than 19. The correct option C is correct because if the first number in numList is any value besides 0, then the first number is added twice, resulting in an incorrect sum. 

* Q32: Option C is correct because if count is defined as 0 outside of the loop

* Q37: Option D is correct because it first sets x equal to max, but then it moves on to the next if statement and changes y equal to max, which is incorrect. 

* Q49: Optio nD is correct because saving copies of most visited websites would not affect the lesser visited websites. These websites would still be accessible by users.
