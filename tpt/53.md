# 5.3 Computing Bias
--------

## Notes
* Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation 
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software developmen


## Actions
### Watch the video... HP computers are racist
The owner of the computer does not think it was intentional because he and his coworker were laughing it off like a joke. This problem was not intentional but it still should be corrected so that people of all races can get access to this feature. This problem may have happened because the database that was used for machine learning for facial recognition may have only been composed of lighter skin people. To avoid this problem, the database should be composed of people of all races.
