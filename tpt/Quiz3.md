## Corrections

* Q1: Option B, removing 2 connections, would be correct because by only removing connections UV and UP then device T can no longer communicate with device U
* Q13: Option B is wrong, because it only calculates the amount to be paid beyond the 25th unit, but doesn't add the amount of the first 25 units. Option C is correct, because it calculates the total price of the first 25 units, and then adds it to the total price of the remaining units.
* Q18: Option C is correct, because the procedure goes through the list and when it gets to the value 1, the procedure returns (true) when it shoudl return (false) because (myList) contains the value -1, which is negative.
* Q18: Option D is incorrect, because from the data, it can be determined the proportion of students who improved their grade after dropping their lowest score. Option A is correct, becuase the data doesn't contain any information about the highest assignment score of each student. 
* Q35: Option D is correct because if an album is bought through a licensed music store, it won't violate the DMCA
